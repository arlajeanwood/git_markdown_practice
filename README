#### By _**{Arla Jean Wood}**_

## Description

_{I tried to replicate a news article from npr about why voters are so scared this voting season. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _In theory this should all just work but it's a markdown file that I opened in Atom._

_{I want to make this easier for you but I have no fucking idea what I'm doing! Hopefully it works.  Praise technology.}_

## Known Bugs

_{Well it's a markdown file in Atom so, I feel like I should be using html formatting instead of markdown but...we'll see! }_

## Support and contact details

_{Please contact Arla Jean Wood at pabloandarla@gmail.com if you there are any problems}_

## Technologies Used

_{I made the initial document on Dillenger but then made a markdown doc in my project folder which opened in Atom.}_
